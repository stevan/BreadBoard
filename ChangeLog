Revision history for Perl extension Bread::Board

0.14
    * Bread::Board::Container
      - added the ->resolve method to replace
        the ->fetch($service)->get pattern
        that annoys mst so much.
        - adjusted all the tests to account
          for this change.
        - adjusted all the docs to now use
          this approach instead

    - now using Try::Tiny for all exception
      handling (except the Deferred service)

    * Bread::Board::Service::WithDependencies
      - if you want to depend on a parameterized
        service, now you can and it will return
        a Bread::Board::Service::Deferred::Thunk
        that you can call ->resolve on and pass
        in the parameters for it.
        - added tests for this

    * Bread::Board::Service::Deferred::Thunk
      - added this + tests for it

0.13 Fri. April 23, 2010
    * Bread::Board
      - making the include keyword handle
        compilation errors better (doy)
          - added test for this

    * Bread::Board::Container
      Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized
      - it is now possible to store parameterized
        containers within regular containers and
        have them behave properly
          - added tests for this

    * Bread::Board::Manual::Example::*
      - adding some examples of ways to use
        Bread::Board to the manual
          - added tests to confirm they work

0.12 Sun. April 18, 2010
    * Bread::Board
      - added the `include` keyword which will evaluate
        an external file within your Bread::Board
        configuration
          - added tests for this
      - added support for parameterized containers
          - added tests for this
      - the 'container' keyword will now accept an
        instance of Bread::Board::Container instead
        of the name, this makes subclassing easier
          - added tests for this

    + Bread::Board::Container::Parameterized
      - added this module and tests

    + Bread::Baord::Manual
      - moved, re-organizad and added too the docs
        that were previously in Bread::Board.pm

0.11 Thu. Mar. 25, 2010
    * Much improved documentation.
    * Fixed inc/ to include all used Module-Install extensions.

0.10 Mon. Feb. 22, 2010
    * Bread::Board
      - import strict and warnings into the caller
        upon import (Florian Ragwitz)
      - fixing the SYNOPSIS so that it will actually
        run (thanks to zby for spotting this)

    * Bread::Board::ConstructorInjection
      - Add a constructor_name parameter for classes using
        MooseX::Traits or other things which need an alternately
        named constructor. (Tomas Doran)

0.09 Wed. July 29, 2009
    Add cloning support for containers and services
    (thanks to jrockway for this)
      - adding tests for this

    * Bread::Board::ConstructorInjection
      - use meta->constructor_name instead of "new"
        if possible (jrockway)

    * Bread::Board::Service::WithParameters
      - fixing a leak where we would hold onto
        parameters that were passed into get()

0.08 Sat. July 18, 2009
    - updating dates on all files

    * Bread::Board::LifeCycle::Singleton::WithParameters
      - new module added to support the idea of a singleton
        lifecycle keyed on the parameters rather then just
        a per-instance item.

    * Bread::Board::Traversable
      - fixed the is_weak_ref mis-spelling

0.07 Wed. Feb. 18, 2009
    - Work with new MooseX::Params::Validate
    - Specify MX::P::Validate version number in Makefile.PL

0.06 Mon. Nov. 3, 2008
    - Forgot to update MANIFEST before uploading to CPAN.

0.05 Mon. Nov. 3, 2008
    - Applied immutablity to classes where applicable, and vigorously unimport
      Moose keywords when they are no longer needed. This results in
      x 2 performance as far as defining a Bread::Board model (Daisuke Maki).

    * Bread::Board
      - Implemented unimport(), thus allowing you to remove keywords
        exported by Bread::Board (Daisuke Maki).

    * Bread::Board::Traversable
      - Unrolled recursive calls to loops, and removed Sub::Current dependency
        (Daisuke Maki)

0.04 Fri. Oct. 31, 2008
    * Bread::Board
      Bread::Board::Traversable
      - fix root path handling (thanks to Daisuke Maki)
        - added tests for this

    * Bread::Board::Dumper
      - Simple utility for dumping containers
        (thanks to Daisuke Maki)

    * t/
      - fixing the plans so that new versions of
        Test::More stop complaining

0.03 Tues. Jan. 8, 2008
    * Bread::Board::Service::WithParameters
      - fixed the parameter validation to
        use a custom cache key, this is so
        that it plays nicely with the new
        MooseX::Params::Validate
        - added tests for this

0.02 Tues. Jan. 8, 2008
    - forgot a dependency, whoops.

0.01 Mon. Jan. 7, 2008
    - Out with the old (IOC) and in
      with the new (Bread::Board)
