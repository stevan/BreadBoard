=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<service|Bread::Board::Service> class instantiates objects by
calling the constructor on a class.

This class consumes L<Bread::Board::Service::WithClass>,
L<Bread::Board::Service::WithParameters>,
L<Bread::Board::Service::WithDependencies>.

=attr C<class>

Attribute provided by L<Bread::Board::Service::WithClass>. This
service makes it a required attribute: you can't call a constructor if
you don't have a class.

=attr C<constructor_name>

Optional string, indicates the name of the class method to invoke to
construct the object. If not provided, defaults to the constructor
name obtained via L<Class::MOP::Class>, or C<new> if introspection
does not work.

=method C<get>

Calls the constructor (as indicated by L</constructor_name>) on the
L</class>, passing all the L<service
parameters|Bread::Board::Service/params> as a B<hash>. Returns
whatever the constructor returned (hopefully a correctly-constructed
object of the right class).
