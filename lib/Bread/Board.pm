=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bread::Board is an inversion of control framework with a focus on
dependency injection and lifecycle management. It's goal is to
help you write more decoupled objects and components by removing
the need for you to manually wire those objects/components together.

Loading this package will automatically load the rest of the packages needed by
any Bread::Board configuration.
  
=head1 EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

The functions of this package provide syntactic sugar to help you build your
Bread::Board configuration. You can build such a configuration by constructing
each of the classes directly instead, but your code may be more difficult to
understand.

=over 4

=item I<container ($name, &body)>

This function provides a shortcut for defining your containers. This function
constructs and returns an instance of L<Bread::Board::Container>. The C<&body>
block may be used to add services or sub-containers within the newly constructed
container. The block is optional. Usually, the block is not passed direclty, but
passed using the C<as> function.

For example,

  container 'MyWebApp' => as {
      service my_dispatcher => (
          class => 'MyWebApp::Dispatcher',
      );
  };

=item I<container ($container_instance, &body)>

In many cases, subclassing L<Bread::Board::Container> is the easiest route to
getting access to this framework. You can do this and still get all the
benefites of the syntactic sugar for configuring that class by passing an
instance of your contianer subclass to C<container>.

You could, for example, configure your container inside the C<BUILD> method of your class.

  package MyWebApp;
  use Moose;

  extends 'Bread::Board::Container';

  sub BUILD {
      my $self = shift;

      container $self => as {
          service dbh => ( ... );
      };
  }

=item I<container ($name, [ @parameters ], &body)>

A third way of using the C<container> method is to build a parameterized
container. These are useful as a way of providing a placeholder for parts of
the configuration that may be provided later. You may not use an instance
object in place of the C<$name> in this case.

For more detail on how you might use parameterized containers, see
L<Bread::Board::Manual::Concepts::Advanced/Parameterized Containers>.

=item I<as (&body)>

This is just a replacement for the C<sub> keyword that is easier to read when
defining containers.

=item I<service ($name, $literal | %service_description)>

Within the C<as> blocks for your containers, you may construct services using
the C<service> function. This will construct any kind of service based upon
how it is defined.

To build a literal service using L<Bread::Board::Literal>, just specify a
scalar value or reference you want to use as the literal value:

  # In case you need to adjust the gravitational constant of the Universe
  service gravitational_constant => 6.673E-11;

To build a service using one of the injection services, just fill in all the
details required to use that sort of injection:

  service search_service => (
      class => 'MyApp::Search',
      block => sub {
          my $s = shift;
          MyApp::Search->new($s->param('url'), $s->param('type'));
      },
      dependencies => {
          url => 'http://example.com/search',
      },
      parameters => {
          type => { isa => 'Str', default => 'text' },
      },
  );

The type of injection performed depends on the parameters used. You may use
the C<service_class> parameter to pick a specific injector class. For
instance, this is useful if you need to use L<Bread::Board::SetterInjection>
or have defined a custom injection service.  If you specify a C<block>, block
injection will be performed using L<Bread::Board::BlockInjection>. If neither
of these is present, constructor injection will be used with
L<Bread::Board::ConstructorInjection>.
      
=item I<depends_on ($service_path)>

The C<depends_on> function creates a L<Bread::Board::Dependency> object for the named C<$service_path> and returns it.

=item I<wire_names (@service_names)>

This function is just a shortcut for passing a hash reference of dependencies into the service.

  service foo => (
      class => "Pity::TheFoo',
      dependencies => wire_names(qw( foo bar baz )),
  );

The above is identical to:

  service foo => (
      class => 'Pity::TheFoo',
      dependencies => {
          foo => depends_on('foo'),
          bar => depends_on('bar'),
          baz => depends_on('baz'),
      },
  );

=item I<typemap ($type, $service | $service_path)>

This feature is new (read: experimental).

This creates a type mapping for the named type. Typically, it is paired with the C<infer> call like so:

  typemap 'MyApp::Model::UserAccount' => infer;

For more details on what type mapping is and how it works, see L<Bread::Board::Manual::Concepts::Typemap>.

=item I<infer (?%hints)>

This is used with C<typemap> to help create the typemap inference. It can be used with no arguments to do everything automatically. However, in some cases, you may want to pass a service instance as the argument or a hash of service arguments to change how the type map works. For example, if your type needs to be constructed using a setter injection, you can use an inference similar to this:

  typemap 'MyApp::Model::UserPassword' => infer( service_class => 'Bread::Board::SetterInjection' );

For more details on what type mapping is and how it works, see L<Bread::Board::Manual::Concepts::Typemap>.

=item I<include ($file)>

This is a shortcut for loading another Bread::Board configuration from another file. 

  include "filename.pl";

The above pretty much identical to running:

  do "filename.pl";

However, you might find it more readable to use C<include>.

=item I<alias ($service_name, $service_path, %service_description)>

This helper allows for the creation of service aliases, which allows you to define a service in one place and then res-use that service with a different name somewhere else. This is sort of like a symbolic link for services. Aliases will be resolved recursively, so an alias can alias an alias.

For example,

  service file_logger => (
      class => 'MyApp::Logger::File',
  );

  alias my_logger => 'file_logger';

=head1 OTHER FUNCTIONS

These are not exported, but might be helpful to you.

=over 4

=item I<set_root_container ($container)>

You may use this to set a top-level root container for all container definitions. 

For example,

  my $app = container MyApp => as { ... };

  Bread::Board::set_root_container($app);

  my $config = container Config => as { ... };

Here the C<$config> container would be created as a sub-container of C<$app>.
